# Privacy Policy for Organizations Info App

Effective Date: 2025-01-01

The Organizations Info App ("the App") is built on the Atlassian Forge platform and is designed to enhance Jira Service Management portals by displaying organization-specific data directly in the customer portal.

## Data Collection
The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information outside of Atlassian Forge infrastructure.  
All information is stored securely within Atlassian Forge **Storage API**, scoped to your Atlassian site.

## Data Usage
- Data provided via webtriggers is stored in Forge storage and displayed in Jira Service Management portals.  
- No data is sent to external servers or third parties.  
- The App only uses the minimum required permissions (scopes) defined in the manifest.

## Security
- Data is secured by Atlassian Forge infrastructure.  
- Access to the data is limited to your Atlassian instance.  
- External integrations (via webtrigger) are protected by a token.
